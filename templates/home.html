    <p>Obesity is a highly prevalent, severe, and costly chronic disease defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to an individual’s health. Since 1975, the worldwide obesity rate has tripled (World Health Organization, 2021). The CDC estimates that obesity costs the U.S. healthcare system nearly $173 billion per year. The obesity epidemic is a growing concern as obesity is linked to other illnesses such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, several types of cancer, hypertension, and depression. Because obesity has a significant impact on physical and emotional health, it is important to identify individuals at risk, promote healthy behaviors, and monitor individuals’ progress. The body mass index (BMI), a value used to estimate the amount of body fat derived from the ratio of an individual’s height to their body weight, is used to screen for obesity. According to the World Health Organization, a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal weight; 25 to 29.9 overweight; and 30 or higher, obese. However, BMI does not displace clinical judgment as this measure does not account for body composition such as muscle mass, bone density, and variation in body shape. Because muscle and bone are denser than fat, BMI can either overestimate body fat in individuals (such as athletes) with high bone density and muscle mass or underestimate it in individuals with low bone density and muscle mass, such as the older population. Other characteristics such as ethnicity, race, and age may also modify the risk associated with a given BMI (The Obesity Society, 2022). Population health management tools can be valuable in addressing this complex disease.</p>
